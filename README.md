Predict-concrete-strength deep learning model trained using Keras. This project is part of the [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer).

## Project Description
- Use a dataset about the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients to train a deep learning model using Keras.
- Predict the strength of the concrete based on the given features using the regression.
- Compare and contrast the mean of the `mean_squared_error` by tweaking the model such as:
  - the number of hidden layers
  - the number of `epochs`
  - normalized and un-normalized inputs
